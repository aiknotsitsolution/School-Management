// Permission format: "module:action"

// Class Teacher is a *responsibility* layered on a teacher account (homeroom
// ownership via TeacherAssignment-type="class_teacher") — not a distinct
// permission surface and NOT a User role. Assignment data decides WHERE a
// teacher can act; the bundle decides WHAT a teacher can do.
